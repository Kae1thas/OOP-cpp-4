# Labwork 4

Objective of the work: to study the principle of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) inheritance. Implement the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming.

Task:
1. Define a class named WORKER containing the following fields:
- Worker's full name.
- Title of the position.
- Year of employment.
Define methods to access these fields and overloaded extraction and insertion operators for objects of type WORKER.

2. Write a program that performs the following actions:
- Input data from the keyboard into an array consisting of ten objects of type WORKER; records should be arranged alphabetically.
- Display on the screen the surnames of workers whose length of service in the organization exceeds the value entered from the keyboard.
- If there are no such workers, display a corresponding message.

During this laboratory work, I studied fundamental concepts (classes, subclasses, and methods) and learned to implement the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming.
